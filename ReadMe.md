### Creative portion involves:
* Being able to separate events into 4 different tags.  
* Year view navigation on the side bar to enable   faster switching between months and years.  
* Adding event after selecting a cell would prefill the add event with specified date.  
* Overflow in each cell is handled by enabling scroll.  
* Export events from selected tags of calendar to a well formatted CSV file which can then be imported to Google Calendar. So you get all features of google calendar. Ples giv xtra crdzs
