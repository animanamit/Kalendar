The link to the project can be found [here](http://ec2-52-15-37-3.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/~siamabdalilah/calendar/calendar.html)

Creative portion involves:
* Being able to separate events into 4 different tags.
* Faster navigation on the side bar to be able to switch between months and years faster.
* Adding event after selecting a cell would prefill the add event with specified date.
* Export events from selected tags of calendar to a well formatted CSV file which can then be imported to Google Calendar. So you get all features of google calendar. Ples giv xtra crdzs
